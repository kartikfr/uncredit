### 📊 **API Response Structure & Tag Extraction**

#### **Key Savings Values (from `savings` array)**

| **Display Label** | **API Tag** | **Search Location** | **Example** |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Net Annual Savings** | `roi` | `product_usps` array | "Net Annual Savings: ₹17,500" |
| **Total Annual Savings** | `max_potential_savings` | `max_potential_savings` array | "Total Annual Savings: ₹18,000" |
| **Joining Fees** | `joining_fees` | `joining_fees` array | "Joining Fees: ₹500" |

#### **Category Breakdown (from `spending_breakdown_array`)**

```json
{
  "savings": [
    {
      "spending_breakdown_array": [
        {
          "category": "amazon_spends",
          "amount_spent": 5000,
          "category_display": "Amazon Shopping",
          "tag": "amazon_spends",
          "savings": 250,
          "percentage": 12.5
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 🎯 **Display Logic**

#### **1. Net Annual Savings Section**
- **Primary Value**: Extract from `roi` tag in `product_usps`
- **Fallback**: Calculate as `max_potential_savings - joining_fees`
- **Display**: Large prominent number with "Net Annual Savings" label

#### **2. Total Annual Savings**
- **Source**: Extract from `max_potential_savings` tag
- **Display**: Secondary value with "Total Annual Savings" label

#### **3. Joining Fees**
- **Source**: Extract from `joining_fees` tag
- **Display**: Secondary value with "Joining Fees" label

#### **4. Category Breakdown**
- **Source**: `spending_breakdown_array` under `savings`
- **Mapping**: Each item maps to user input by `category` field
- **Display**: Show user spending vs calculated savings per category

### 🔍 **Tag Extraction Logic**

```javascript
// Extract value by tag from API response
const extractValueByTag = (cardData, tag) => {
  // 1. Search in product_usps array
  if (cardData.product_usps && Array.isArray(cardData.product_usps)) {
    const uspItem = cardData.product_usps.find(usp => 
      usp.tag === tag || 
      usp.description.toLowerCase().includes(tag.replace('_', ' '))
    );
    if (uspItem) {
      return extractNumericValue(uspItem.description);
    }
  }
  
  // 2. Search in max_potential_savings array
  if (cardData.max_potential_savings && Array.isArray(cardData.max_potential_savings)) {
    const savingsItem = cardData.max_potential_savings.find(item => 
      item.tag === tag || 
      item.description.toLowerCase().includes(tag.replace('_', ' '))
    );
    if (savingsItem) {
      return extractNumericValue(savingsItem.description);
    }
  }
  
  // 3. Direct property access
  if (cardData[tag] !== undefined) {
    return Number(cardData[tag]) || 0;
  }
  
  return 0;
};
```
